'''
Write a Program in Python to accept studentâ€Ÿs five courses marks and compute his/her
result. Student is passing if he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course.
If student scores aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is distinction. If
aggregate is 60>= and <75 then the grade if first division. If aggregate is 50>= and
<60, then the grade is second division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is
third division.
