	Problem Definition/Statement
	
	
Group A: (Basics of Python Programming)

1	Write a program in Python to calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay. Let employee pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions.


2	Write a program in Python to accept N numbers from user. Compute and display maximum in list, minimum in list, sum and average of numbers.


3	Write a program in Python to accept from user the number of Fibonacci numbers to be generated and print the Fibonacci series.


Group B (Functions & Modules)


4	Write a program in Python to accept the number and Compute
a)	square root of number, 
b)	Square of number,
c)	Cube of number 
d)	check for prime, 
e)	factorial of number
f)	prime factors
5	Write a program in Python to accept a number from user and print digits of number in a reverse order.
6	Write a Program in Python to input binary number from user and convert it into decimal number.


Group C ( Strings & Files )


7	Write a python program that accepts a string from user and perform following string operations- 
a)	Calculate length of string
b)	String reversal 
c)	Equality check of two strings 
d)	Check palindrome 
e)	Check substring f}1.	Write a program in Python to count total characters in file, total words in file, total lines in file and frequency of given word in file.

	2.	Write a Program in Python to copy contents of one file to other. While copying a) all full stops are to be replaced with commas b) lower case are to be replaced with upper case c) upper case are to be replaced with lower case.
Group D (Object Oriented Programming)
9	1.	Write a program in Python that Create class EMPLOYEE for storing details (Name, Designation, gender, Date of Joining and Salary). Define function members to compute
a)	total number of employees in an organization 
b)	count of male and female employee 
c)	Employee with salary more than 10,000 
d)	Employee with designation “Asst Manager”
